This is an alpha release. For testing only. Use at your own risk. Do not distribute.

To run a test
-------------
Pick one of the world_*.dat files and rename it to 'world' ('world.exe' under Windows). Then make it executable.
Also download "cortex.w" and the test/ directory.
Start world from a terminal.
At the world prompt do this:

w> test		; should return true
w> m		; will run a Mandelbrot example

If it behaves this way, you're ready to go.
Have fun!

Known issues
------------

- The memory handling system can't cope with cyclic references yet. This happens also with functions, blocks, etc. within contexts, because of binding rules.

- Operators doesn't support lit-words as their first argument.

- Routines can't handle all possible types of arguments.
